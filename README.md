# This project likely aims to detect lane lines or edges in images, which is a crucial step in various applications like autonomous driving, lane departure warning systems, and road sign recognition. The process involves several steps:

Image Preprocessing: Converting the image to grayscale and applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise, which helps in better edge detection.
Region of Interest Selection: Defining a specific area in the image where lane lines are expected and masking out other areas.
Edge Detection Methods: Applying different edge detection algorithms like Laplacian, Sobel, and Canny to highlight edges in the image.
Visualization: Displaying the original image along with the detected edges using Matplotlib.
